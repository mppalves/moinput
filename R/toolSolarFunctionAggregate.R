  ### FS: map and aggregate FLH bins from DLR data to REMIND grades
  
  # method: 
  # 1. cumulative potential (maxprod) is calculated in descending order of FLHs 
  # 2. cumulative potential is normalized by current (2015) FE electricity consumption (IEA)
  # 3. cumulative potential vs. FLH is interpolated between given data points step-wise and linearly
  # to have at least one point in each REMIND grade
  # 4. cumulative potential is mapped to REMIND grades by dividing it according to grade.breaks parameter (e.g. if 1. grade:
  # 0-0.2, that means that the top 20%  of locations are mapped into the first REMIND grade)
  # 5. all potential that is above the last value of grade breaks are mapped into the last grade
  # 6. an exception is made for regions/technologies where total potential is below the lower bound of the last grade s.t.
  # last grade would be emtpy -> here the grades are determined by equally spaced bins of potential up to the total potential (e.g. for Japan)
